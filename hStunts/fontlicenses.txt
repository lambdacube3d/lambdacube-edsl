Homepage: http://mickeyavenue.com

Please include this Prototype.txt file with any redistribution.

INSTALLATION: To install any TrueType font, simply copy it to your Windows\Fonts folder.


PROTOTYPE is an original font based on the signage typeface used at Walt Disney World's Epcot theme park. It can also be seen on the monorails and in Disneyland's Tomorrowland.

v2.0 includes the full character set -- all capitals and lowercase, punctuation, numbers, symbols, and international characters. All of the "missing" characters have been redrawn to emulate the "Prototype" look as closely as possible. 

Thanks to Fudgie (loranges.com) for all of his help with gathering photos and testing the prototype Prototype.

Thanks also to Scott Terek for sending samples and photographing "the elusive Q"!
